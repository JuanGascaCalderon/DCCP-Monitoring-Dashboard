# DCCP-Monitoring-Dashboard

## Overview
  - This project addresses the operational needs of SLB's global contact center desks through the development of a comprehensive Power BI report integrated with the Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform (DCCP). The report focuses on delivering real-time insights into critical metrics including queued conversations, service factors, abandonment rates, agent statuses, and overall call performance. By centralizing these key metrics within a unified interface, team leads, coordinators, and analysts can swiftly pinpoint areas for enhancement and make well-informed decisions aimed at improving customer service quality.
